1. Introduction

Hi! right now you're looking at trashy, the sane rm intermediary.
This means that you've probably just done the unthinkable:
accidentally rm'd a super important file by accident and immediately
thereafter started cursing God, UNIX, GNU, computers, and yourself.

Never fear.  There is hope.


2. Usage

Trashy is a simple shell script that introduces the idea of a trash
can for the command line.  Meaning that you can issue this command:

trash foo

and foo will be moved to ~/.trash

Simple as that.  When you're really really sure that everything in
your .trash folder wants to be nuked out of existance, then you can
issue the command:

empty

and your .trash will be emptied.


3. Aliases

To help myself ease into the concept of the trash command, I literally
had to alias rm to trash for a while.  This works quite well, in
truth; and if you ever want to override your alias, simply use:

\rm foo

or

/bin/rm foo

Simple as that.

But until your muscle memory gets used to the idea that it's going to
be typing 'trash' instead of 'rm' when you want to delete a file, the
alias helps.  To have an alias installed along with trashy, simple
uncomment the alias block in the install.sh script.


4. System Integration

I plan on integration trashy with the freedesktop.org Trash

http://www.ramendik.ru/docs/trashspec.html

But for now, we have the hack you see now.


5. Why trashy?

Trashy is BASHy, meaning that it's really really portable.  It can be
installed easily on GNU Linux, freeBSD, and Mac OS X.  Probably more,
but these are the systems I have tried it on.  In all three cases,
there are no real dependencies (except BASH on BSD but that's not so
terribly uncommon).

It's simple, but it works well and it works on lots of systems.
That's good enough for me.

Similar projects do exist.  The one I know of uses Python and has some
really neat and fancy features and probably already conforms to Free
Desktop specs.  Check it out if you're on a Linux box or if you don't
mind a bit of set-up on non Free Desktop UNIX systems.
