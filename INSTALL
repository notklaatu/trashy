Install
=======

There are several ways to install trashy:


Generic
-------

On just about any POSIX system, run the install script included with
the trashy source code.

    $ sudo ./install.sh


Manual
------

If that fails, the really simple and dirty method is to copy the
trashy script into your PATH, such as ~/bin or /usr/local/bin, or
whatever you have available to you.


Slackware
---------

On Slackware Linux, run the SlackBuild script included with the trashy
source code.

    $ su -
    # ./trashy.SlackBuild


RPM
---

If you use a distribution that uses RPMs, a package may be available
at http://klaatu.fedorapeople.org/trashy


Manual RPM
----------

If not, build an RPM from the trashy.spec file included with the
trashy source code. First, install the toolchain:

    # dnf install rpmdevtools

Set up the RPM environment:

    $ pmdev-setuptree

Copy the SPEC file into your tree:

    $ cp path/to/trashy.spec ~/rpmbuild/SPECS

Place the source into your tree:

    $ cp path/to/trashy-source.tar.bz2 ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

Build:

    $ rpmbuild -ba ~/rpmbuild/SPECS/trashy.spec

Install:

    $ sudo dnf install ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/noarch/trash*rpm
